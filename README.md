# Identification of ligand and receptor interactions in CKD and MASH through the integration of single cell and spatial transcriptomics


**Background**

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) are metabolic fibroinflammatory diseases. Combining single-cell (scRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) could give unprecedented molecular disease understanding at single-cell resolution. A more comprehensive analysis of the cell-specific ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions could provide pivotal information about signaling pathways in CKD and MASH.

**Results**

The analytical framework identified L-R pairs involved in cellular crosstalk in CKD and MASH. Interactions between cell types were identified using scRNAseq data and were validated by checking the spatial co-presence using the ST data and the co-expression of the communicating targets. Several of the L-R protein pairs identified are known key players in CKD and MASH, while others are novel potential targets that were previously observed only in animal models.

**Conclusion**

Our study highlights the importance of integrating different modalities of transcriptomic data for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms. The combination of single-cell resolution from scRNAseq data, combined with tissue slide investigations and visualization of cell-cell interactions obtained through ST, paves the way for the identification of future potential therapeutic targets and developing effective therapies.
